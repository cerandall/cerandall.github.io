<h3>Introducing Myself</h3>
<img src="lib/img/cr-head-460a-vsm.jpg" alt="Charles Randall owner of Randall Concepts Ltd." align="right" />
I am an audio and broadcast systems engineer with wide-ranging experience. Having worked with <A href="http://www.feba.org.uk" title="Feba Radio Uk website">Feba Radio</a> for 24 years I am now run <a href="http://www.randallconcepts.com">Randall Concepts Ltd</a>.  I am manufacturing the Ranger 4 suitcase studio and other specialist electronic products.</p>

<p>I began my career with six years as technical assistant to the legendary <a href="http://www.rupertneve.com" title="website of Rupert Neve designs">Rupert Neve</a> and Geoff Watts from whom I gained a solid foundation in mixer design and audio systems. In addition we installed sound systems in some leading churches and ran the Cambridge Radio Course for radio producers.</p>

<p>
 I worked for Feba Radio for 24 years and estalished their audio engineering team 20 years ago.  For the last few years I have been the Principal Audio Engineer. During this time I have worked on all aspects of radio and recording studios, designing, building, installing and comissioning systems in many countries especially in the developing world. I have designed and built custom equipment where this has not been available.  Most notably I was the lead designer for the Chrysolite Suitcase Studio now updated and re-launched as the Ranger studio  (see below). More biographical information is available on <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/charleserandall">my LinkedIn profile</a>.</p>

<h3>Ranger Suitcase Studio</h3>
<a href="http://www.randallconcepts.com/suitcase/suitcase.html" title="Randall Concepts Ranger suitcase studio details ">Ranger studio pages</a><br />
<img src="lib/img/chrysolite-cr-441-vsm.jpg" alt="Charles Randall with the predecessor to the Ranger studio" align="left" />


  Randall Concepts Ltd is now manufacturing the Ranger series of portable studio equipment for different applications.  Please see the  The <a href="http://www.randallconcepts.com" title="www.randallconcepts.com - the home of the Ranger suitcase studio">Ranger</a> pages for details.</p>

<p>The Ranger 4 is an updated version of the suitcase studio was developed by the FEBA UK engineers from my original concept.  It is  a fully professional studio system that is completely pre-packaged and ready to go without unpacking or dismounting equipment.  It can be operated by simply opening the case and switching on. No further setting up is needed other than  to plug the headphones.</p>

<p>
 It is ideally suited for disaster relief, emergency broadcasting, training,start-up studios and radio stations, and as a temporary studio to to replace stolen or damaged equipment.  The suitcase studios  has been used in all of these roles in many countries and climates. Feba built 30 Chrysolites, 26 have gone overseas</p>

<p>
The Chrysolite  was  short-listed for the 2009 <a href="http://www.aib.org.uk" title="website of the AIB">Association of International Broadcasters</a> (AIB) <i>Most innovative technology</i> award and has been used as an emergency radio station in several locations.   </p>

<h3>Broadcast and Audio</h3>
<img src="lib/img/turnkey-crm-sm.jpg" align="right" alt="Turnkey Control room with digital broadcast console under test before export - Photo copyright Feba, used by permission" />
I have been building analogue and digital studio systems for my entire career and have a great deal of experience working with users and in systems integration, installation and commissioning.  We have built turnkey systems in the UK as well as on-site installations and upgrades.</p>

<p>During this time I introduced many new technologies to Feba. Most notable was our early adoption of FTP and low bit rate audio compression to deliver programmes from our network of studios around the world to our transmitters.  We were ahead of the field.

<h3>Acoustics and Studio Construction</h3>
<img src="lib/img/pak-studio-14sm.jpg" align="left" alt="Acoustic treatment in a radio studio in Pakistan" />
I have designed and built many recording and radio broadcast studios, most of which are in developing countries.  I have designed all aspects of the studios from the original floor plan to sound-proofing, silenced ventilation and air-conditioning and internal acoustics. this includes lighting and all building services.  I have developed a series of acoustic panels that can be built with locally available materials in most countries.  In some cases they have been adapted to use unorthodox materials where that is all that is available locally.

<h3>Audio-Visual Systems</h3>
Many of the broadcast disclipines cross over well into the field of AV.  Building rock solid high quality systems with long cable runs in high interference broadcast environments is a good foundation for AV. With the convergence and increasing integration of audio, induction loop, video, video-conferencing, lighting, web casting and IT.</p>

<p>I was installing sound systems in churches early in my career and have returned to this in recent years. As someone who has spent much  of their career in and around Christian ministry I understand the ministry requirements. I am used to working in Grade One listed buildings. I am responsible for AV systems in my own church and frequently mix which keeps my hand in as a user.
